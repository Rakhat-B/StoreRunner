# StoreRunner
StoreRunner Unity game project
What is working right now:
- Movement
- Simple procedural maze generation
- Random enemy movement
- Player HP and enemy damage
- Main item pick up option
- Simple models
What needs to be added:
- Better models and animations
- UI
- Main menus
- Better maze generation with different sections
Thats all for now.
